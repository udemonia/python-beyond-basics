The first of the three pillars

Encapsulation refers to the safe storage of data (as attributes)

Data Should Be Accessed Only Through Instance Attributes

Data Should Be Validated as Correct (according to the requirements set in the class methods)

Data Should Be Safe From Changes By External Processes

---------------Data Created via Setter methods (can do it outside of the method - breaking encapsulation)

-----------------------------Later we will learn to force encapsulation 

---------------Encapsulation in python is a voluntary restriction 

---------------Python does not implement data hiding like other languages
