Class - Blueprint for creating objects

Instance - a constructed object from a Class

Type - indicates the class that the object belongs to

Attribute - any object value object.Attribute

Method - a 'Callable Attribute' defined in the class - the verb, function within a class

every method is an Attribute but not every Attribute is a method!

instance, method and Attribute

a car is a class of objet 

the car class is a blueprint for a class - platonic ideal

each instance of a car does the same thing (methods) start() stop() honk()

each car has its own state - Attributes

Each car has a left door but the state of each instance can be different - open, locked etc.
